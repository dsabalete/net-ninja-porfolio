                performing and well tested.</p>

                experience for the users of my
                software both visual and accessible. Mixing powerful tools and knowledge about the users brings visual UI's
                to
                life and leads to webpages being accessible and useful.</p>
            <p class="text-lg py-2">I am a team player and I enjoy working in a team where we can learn from each other and
                grow together. I am also
                a fast learner and I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.</p>
